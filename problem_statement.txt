Let us call an integer sided triangle with sides a<=b<=c barely acute if the sides satisfy a2+b2=c2+1

How many barely acute triangles are there with perimeter no greater than N ?


Input Format

First line of each test file contains a single integer Q that is the number of queries per test file. Q lines follow, each with a single integer N .


Constraints

1<=Q<=50
10<=N<=5*10^7


Output Format

Print exactly Q lines with an answer for the corresponding query on each.
